                        <h3>Problems with Current Methods</h3>
                        <p>Learning the modes has been one of the most mystifying experience amongst music students.  These students then become teachers
                            who will then pass on the knowledge and perhaps some of the confusion, thus perpetuating rather than fixing the problem in 
                            educating modal playing.  Here I will teach you the modes the right way which starts with how YOU the listeners hear music
                            rather than visually what the modes are based on, thus making the modes useful in a musical context rather than inapplicable
                            knowledge.
                        </p>
